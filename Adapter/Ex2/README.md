Let's say you're building an e-commerce website that allows customers to pay for their purchases using various payment providers, such as PayPal, Stripe, and Authorize.net. Each payment provider has its own API and interface for processing payments, and you want to integrate all of them into your website so that customers can choose their preferred payment method.
However, integrating all of these payment providers into your website can be challenging because they each have their own set of methods and parameters for processing payments. To solve this problem, you can use the Adapter pattern to create a uniform interface that all of the payment providers can use.




In this example, we have three payment providers, PayPal, Stripe, and AuthorizeDotNet, each with its own payment processing method. We then create an adapter, PaymentAdapter, that adapts the payment provider interfaces to a uniform pay() method.
The adapter checks the type of the payment provider and calls the appropriate payment processing method, transforming any necessary parameters along the way. This allows us to integrate multiple payment providers into our website using a single, uniform interface.
