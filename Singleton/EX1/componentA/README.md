Here is the breakdown of the above piece of code:

The aim of this code is to make sure that we attach the onChange handler for the color picker that is present inside the component-a. In this case, componentA's color picker is identified by id: #color-picker-a.
We need to make sure that this handler:
Sets the value for the property color of the globalState.
Fetches the same property again.
Applies the same value to different areas of the DOM.
Also makes sure that we set the other color picker's value to the global state.
Now, let's take a look at all these steps one-by-one:

First, let's fetch all the required DOM elements.
What we are planning here is to update all the color pickers and span elements with id #selected-color with the value of the current globalState property color whenever the on change event occurs.
In case of componentA, once we change the color via the color picker we need to update the same value in 2 span elements (#selected-color) â€“ that is, one span element of componentB and one span element present in the .global-state div container.
We do this because we want to keep all the components in sync and demosntrate that the value of the global state remains the same across all the components.
We then go ahead and update the color property of the global state using the StateUtility's class method setPropertyValue. We pass on to it event.target.value as this contains the current value present inside the #color-picker-a color picker input.
Once the value is set, we fetch the same property again by using getPropertyByName. We do this to demonstrate that the property color of the global state has been updated and is ready to be used.
Then, we use the setValueOfSimilarElements utility function to update all the elements that are having same class/id name with some value. In this case we update all the #selected-color elements with value color.
Finally, we update the the value of the opposite color picker, that is componentB's color picker #color-picker-b.
